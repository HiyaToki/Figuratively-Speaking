1	i like older books too ! my favorites are the old mark twain books && mark twain was a great american treasure . his books still are relevent today which is amazing .	they are such classics ! he was much more successful as a writer than as a riverboat pilot , i 'm sure !

2	that 's so weird , i wonder why . && i have no experience , but maybe something to do with where the instrument hits around the mouth ?	it 's as strange as a pakistani jazz orchestra !

3	yes and the ancient dodo bird is a sub - family of modern day pigeons ! && that 's neat ! funny thing about ravens is they actually make up with their own species to avoid future arguments .	that is funny . i wish i were as light as a bird - their bones are so hollow that their entire skeleton weighs less than their feathers

4	exactly ! do you like animals ? && i do ! i love me some dogs !	i do too ! i have a husky who seems to be as big as a pony ! did you know dalmations are associated with firefighters originally to specifically calm down the horses ?

5	i enjoyed chatting with you as well ! and yes i 'll go to local pet store and see if they have elephants in stock haha && have a good night	thanks you too ! and watch out for dogs , they 're not actually colorblind but they just do n't see as many colors as a normal human can

8	wow i 'm sorry people will pay for anything whatever happen to a good hard stern talking to ? && if you 're addicted then i 'm not sure how much that would help .	your right just seems like to me parenting has gone by the wayside . did you know that an iphone has as much computing power as a icbm deterrent ?

9	did n't know that , i guess video games can apply to real life ! do you like dogs or cats more ? && i m more of a dog person , what about you ?	ya i 'm a dog person , i held a wonderful dog earlier today ! and apparently dogs are not actually color blind , they just ca n't see as many colors as a human can

10	I know a place that should be perfect . It's called the China Friendship Shopping Center and it's pretty much like an American mall - except with more variety . You can even buy a live chicken there if you want . && Live chicken ? Thanks , but no thanks . So ... tell me about bargaining . How can I do it like a local ?	Well . I'll be honest and say you'll never be as good at bargaining as a local person . You're a foreigner and the sellers can see that . But ... if you're smart , you can get bargains that are not too far away from the local price .

11	Do you have the day off today ? How come you're not at work now ? && I don't have the day off . Our labor union is staging a nationwide strike today , all of the workers in our department are supporting the labor union by participating and not going in to work this week .	Are you serious ? Why would they have to go to such extreme measures like a strike ? Doesn't your company have a pretty good corporate image ? I'll bet the folks at headquarters are going nuts over something as serious as a strike ...

12	You're going go Dresden for sightseeing ? && Yeah.And I'm going by bus .	I think a train journey is as fast as a bus journey .

13	i am a 33rd level master mason , ask away	my grandfather was a grand mason ... where do you both stand as far as stature as a mason ?

17	i 've heard a lot about placebos and really want to try them . how do i get my hands on some ? do i need a prescription ?	yes , you need a prescription but i 've heard that a blank piece of paper is as effective as a prescription about 50 of the time .

18	lets make wolf control easier , shall we ?	some sort of device to give universal commands to all loyal wolves : yes . costs as much iron as a minecart : no .

19	mortal kombat legacy episode 1 is now out !	this is every bit as cheesy and corny as a live action mortal kombat series should be . eddit : kombat as per baron rogue 's correction

20	rep . anthony weiner : what the gop are doing is taking this opportunity to hack away at social safety net programs they never cared about ... i 'm not saying that they do n't like seniors , i 'm just saying that they do n't like them to be poor , or sick , or have any need for care	nothing ever makes me rage as hard as a politician saying let 's put politics aside . i had to pause the video and walk away for a minute

21	dae get emotional when they see animal killed in a movie , but not humans ?	we 're used to having humans dying as a common theme therefore we are less affected emotionally . animals dying is not as common as a theme .

24	a whole lot of girls were liking this image in my facebook feed . i 'm so deeply offended that this has become acceptable .	was n't there 2 facebook links here about a men 's rights conference losing their caterer and ... well , i see this as intended as a joke .

25	pope 's study : priests are n't pedophiles if the kid is over 10 ( and this is just the tip of the iceberg ) .	can we all agree , however , that they are every bit as creepy as a pedophile no matter what the age of the victim is ?

26	' call of duty ' sets sights on a fee consumers are used to paying 60 each for videogames . now the publisher behind the industry 's biggest videogame franchise call of duty is about to find out whether it can get them to pay a monthly bill , too .	people would do it if they had perfect servers , but they do n't . something as reliable as a pc server from last millennium for example .

27	just bought the pc version ... frustrating .	in addition to what others have suggested , i was also told making sure the exe is set to run as an administrator as a solution to search problems .

28	missed my dui court date ... what should i do ?	do n't be a pathetic waste of a human ? you would think that something as important as a court date which determines your future you would check twice .

29	what fascinates you ? i 'm curious .	sociology and firearms . i find individuals not as interesting as studying people as a group . and guns because of the history and their mechanics .

30	this never fails to creep me out	something about the way that this creepy thing is juxtaposed against something as harmless mundane as a supermarket aisle is what is creeping me out the most i think ...

31	squirrels are devouring my tomato plants . what should i do to keep them away ?	air rifle , just as effective as a . 22 but generally easier to get around any kind of legal issues you 'd encounter with a firearm .

33	can 7 grown men take a bear in a fight ?	without any tools and i would doubt it , give them something as simple as a baseball bat and i have no doubt that they could .

34	oh ... sorry !	innocent are now a stable in advertising marketing textbooks as they 're herolded as a success story for their unique approach to packaging . true story .

35	how often should one poop ? how often do you poop ? EOS i poop once or twice a day . EOS if i have a ton of coffee , i can get up to three a day EOS that 's called a shat trick in my house .	thank you , i 'll use shat trick from now on as i feel as a canadian i need to have some link to hockey .

36	i do n't like his music much , but this is the truth .	nice post . em is the real deal as a person and as a lyricist . the rap community has been lucky to have him .

37	this is a diagonal staircase that you can walk straight up .	is n't this just as steep as a diagonal staircase made using slabs ? i thought the point of using unusual materials was to make ultra steep staircases ...

38	how interesting my facebook friends are	however , as time spent as a redditor increases , so does how interesting all your facebook friends think you are . it 's your classic win situation .

39	female starting on ss : reasonable to skip bench presses ?	since you 're a woman , your torso cannot progress as fast as a man 's . you will n't accidentally end up benching 200 lbs with swole arms .

40	so whatever happened to those 15 uniformed marines that were going to protect the protesters from the nypd ?	you are correct , sir . military personnel are not allowed to get involved in political matters such as these as a representative of the armed forces .

41	the hub has most of the mane 6 ' s halloween costumes	( rdsitting ) did anyone else notice that it has rainbow dash 's costume tagged as rainbow dash as a wonderbolt ? is n't that a shadowbolt outfit ?

42	iama freshman college student with adhd , who has taken corrective amphetamines daily since the age of 9 , and is now suffering the severe side effects of long term use . ama	please list the side effects in order of severity , and which ones doctor or the company have confirmed as being as a result of the medication .

43	pulled together this frida kahlo costume in less than an hour .	if you really wanted to be legit , you would 've went as frida kahlo dressed as a man ( but then you would n't of been attractive .

44	who is your favorite singer ?	geoff rickley from thursday . he 's grown so much both as a vocalist and as a songwriter . he 's such a great artistic inspiration !

45	guinness black lager . i just got some and want to know your thoughts on it	i like it . it 's nothing fancy , but it has a decent flavor and it 's not as filling as a regular guinness . good everyday drinker .

46	22 f have always been a bit insecure , and never really get asked out . honest opinion ?	my honest opinion is that you and i need to have a discussion lol my page ( you are about as far from ugly as a person can get

47	some ms paint art i made based on the fibonacci sequence . i 'm not sure whether this is the place for it , but i put a lot of time and calculation into it and wanted to show it to someone .	that 's pretty rad . would you mind explaining your calculations ? i find it cool both as a psychonaut and as a mathematician .

48	just a guy riding his steampunk feline	and he wasnt even going full speed ... imagine if he really opened it up he might be as fast as a normal person walking down the street .

49	there 's a video somewhere of some dudes getting tricked into being punched in the thigh ( read : dead legged ) by kimbo slice . ninja edit :	not only is kimbo slice a horrible fighter , he will never punch as hard as a boxer , let alone ernie shaver . still probably hurt though .

50	oh , nothing , just my frient chilling with his pet prairie dog .	at first , it looked like it was huge . as big as a german shepard . but then i realized i was just mad high .

51	in a similiar vein to the weekly hat raffle , i present to you : the weekly weapon raffle !	well here 's another thing to clutter up tf2 , and it 's not even for something as special as a hat .

52	This is a second English exam from the first semester of the first year of high school. && If number 4 was worded “lift him up from the routine way of seeing things” it would be clearly correct.	Perhaps the problem is as simple as a typo.

53	I don't... Been trying to figure out the hobby thing but literally nothing interests me right now && Do you think you might be depressed?	Also something as simple as a board game night at a game store is a great simple way to meet new people for free and fun.

54	5. && Play the role in another person's life (specifically someone younger than me) where I am the person they can go to and just talk openly with.	I'd listen to whatever it is and watch as they grow as a person and develop.

55	Hong Kong. && I was born and raised there but still, the first time I ever took my wife there on a vacation to meet my parents and old friends was really special.	It meant a lot getting to show her where I'd grown up, stuff as I did as a kid, etc.

56	In my country we have "Drive safe, someone loves you" signs on highways. && My country spams a crap ton of those signs,especially in provincial areas.	It has to do with our buses and taxis that drives as fast as a drift car (no joke).

57	Do you think it'll pick up in demand in the years to come? && Oh, definitely.	It's part of our everyday electronics and already a huge part in many areas such as medicine and materials science (hydrophobic materials as a random example).

58	Yeah it makes me feel kinda hopeless sometimes. && What do u do when u feel like that?	so it sounds kind of dumb but I used to just enjoy going places on my own that I've never been to, even something as simple as a new grocery store.

59	And look how calm I am. && No capslock, no exclamation marks, nothing.	The worst thing I'm going to say is that based purely on its scientific validity, it's as accurate at judging a person's personality as a buzzfeed "Which Disney Princess Are You" clickbait quiz.

60	The only negative effects from being trans occur when the people around the trans person are awful to them. && You may note that the DSM V has disphoria as the illness, not being transgender.	Like, I know why this matters to me, my boyfriend is trans and he's much happier as a guy than he was as a woman.

61	Not passing any sort of judgement, you do you buddy, just trying to gain clarity of your answer. && Not really playing itself, but more like the whole thing of "trying to get better at something with others" part.	I don't really know how to explain this without sounding cheesy, but I guess something about the whole thing felt like I was growing not just as a player but as a person as well.

62	The point being that you would buy the book before you actually needed the information. && After that, the steps would be virtually identical to what you go through today.	Such books are still available today, they just aren't as common (and often come as a CD-ROM rather than a book).

63	I didn’t realize how great the company of someone who just gets me. && I consider myself lucky because recently I noticed I have 5 or 6 people I can just goof off around and just have fun with.	That being said no one is quite as great as a best friend.

64	I'm honestly more partial to the Curse of Blackmoor Manor. && Still, the Nancy Drew game series in general is very underrated for what it is.	I think Blackmoor Manor has better puzzles, but I think the setting is not as generally appealing as a western ranch.

65	It's about this trainee whose name escapes me who desperately wants to wrestle so she enlists in a company called Gaea who run a school to train women. && The trainer is a women named Chigusa Nagoya.	She is incredible as a performer but she is brutal as a trainer.

66	Stick with it every week and make it a priority. && I promise that your dedication will serve you well for the rest of your life.	There is nothing in this world that I have found that can make a person feel as confident, as capable, and as happy as a fit body.

67	I’ve had both and in my opinion, they equally suck. && Which would you rather though?	I’d probably go with one who doesn’t care so much because even though it’d be hurtful, it wouldn’t be as stressful as a controlling partner.

68	It earns you more respect and makes their job easier, which is essentially what most roles are for bosses. && If you are looking for another job, keep it to yourself.	Don't let your bosses know or other co-workers as stories of people doing this as a courtesy without having anything else lined up got them fired before getting a new job.

69	Just wondering but what do you work? && I mean checking out is the easiest of all jobs and you probably have never worked in sales.	Prior to my current job I worked retail for several years as management and as a frontline employee.

70	I will always remember this woman, I just feel like a coward for not being able to bring myself to it && I don't see it as being cowardly, honestly.	If you want to remember her as she was and not as a corpse I don't see anything wrong with that.

71	Guinea pigs are pretty high maintenance, honestly. && They are poop machines and regardless of bedding type or cage size they're going to need cleaning a minimum of once a week.	And it's not as simple as a hamster cage.

72	I hope it hasn't scarred you from friendships forever, but I understand why you've been a little put off. && Are you bisexual by any chance?	I've heard that situations like that are common as people equate bisexuality with non-monogamy and as a baby bi myself I do fear that when I get older.

73	it’s weird. && i love the cold gloominess outside and the holidays so i’m not sure why i feel so down during this time of year	It may even be as simple as a lack of vitamin D

74	I'm not friends with any of mine. && I like to keep to myself, so it's not really a problem for me.	Companionship is a nice thing though, and I get why you are craving it, especially after someone as close as a girlfriend, and being new to where you live.

75	In the morning, after he had said his prayers, and was just going to sit down to work, the two shoes stood quite finished on his table. && He was astounded, and knew not what to say to it.	He took the shoes in his hands to observe them closer, and they were so neatly made that there was not one bad stitch in them, just as if they were intended as a masterpiece.

76	They sell flexible white boards!! && We got one that came in a tube, taped it up on the wall and it’s good to go.	Maybe not quite as sturdy as a real “board” (plus depending on the width of your tape, you could accidentally erase marker shreds/ink onto the wall), but definitely portable, and held up for a year.

77	My mind wanders and I end up thinking about some of the harder to deal with crap at night. && And I totally understand the feeling totally better in the morning and wanting to resolve it.	Maybe I’m weird and my feelings regenerate twice as fast as a normal human’s (that’s an office reference), but I honestly forget about conflict the next morning for the most part.

78	Portable toilet. && Can add solar/dual batteries etc if your budget is inclined.	At the end of the day though you can build a setup fairly cheap that will be functional but maybe not as asthetically pleasing as a fancier setup.

79	Just taking turns left and right as we see fit. && My friends says you will see things you normally wouldn't see if you do it like this.	I actually wish i could go there, not as a tourist by myself but as a tourist guided by someone local that is not involved in the traveling business.

80	I have been influenced I’d say more by the internet than I have by school. && Teens before the internet were stupid because the only way to know anything about life or the world was to live it.	Now an 8 year old can know just as much about American economics as a manager at a company, if they so desire.

81	This is at the Wisconsin Dells. && There are actually two different indoor water/theme parks that offer these swim up bars/outdoor hot tubs here.	The water isn't as warm as a normal hot tub but it still has bubbles and they know mixing alcohol plus very, very hot water isn't a good idea.

82	I want to help someone I know care about school. && More specifically, I just want to help this person try harder and for him to develop the skills that are needed for life later on.	It troubles me so much knowing that this person has SO much potential, both as a student and as a person, but right now, he just...doesn't care.

83	I know that being informed of World events is important to being a productive member of society but the News is just too cancerous for me. && Constantly covering the same thing, pushing personal agendas, constant exaggeration, etc.	makes it impossible for me to watch News😕 Reddit is okay but some comments are too polarized as is US politics as a whole

84	Something finally got the gears turning in my head a few years ago. && I’m pretty sure it was me meeting my partner and entering into a relationship with a man who had a child.	It forced me to grow up, as well as grow as a person.

85	Quite a few people said they don't let they're kids believe in santa, or the Easter bunny, or none of those "magical" characters. && Also just in general, There's a lot less exploring going on with young kids.	Even my brother who's 10 years younger than me (he's 9) didn't go outside and explore nearly as much as I did as a kid.

86	I remember when Doritos came in only one flavor and were stiff enough to cut through paper. && I remember when you had a Telstar or an Atari.	I remember having to order your burger, fries, and soda as three separate items (not as a "combo meal") at McDonald's.

87	Do you visit museums or galleries often? && What is your favourite piece of art/who is your favourite artist?	There are so many more questions I could ask but it all boils down to me asking what is your experience with art (no matter whether it's as an observer or as a creator)?

88	My cat always makes me proud. && He's 19 soon to be 20 and still going strong.	He's still as agile as a kitten too!!

89	People love it if you're interested in them. && Pepper with your own anecdotes to make it naturally flow and you're good.	Don't even need to be good anecdotes, could be as simple as a video you watched.

90	It will man have faith. && Does he live a pretty sedentary lifestyle?	Just something as simple as a 30 min walk a day can have profound effects on health.

91	maybe youve bought something that you wanted for a long time. && maybe you just met with some friends and had a nice day.	i keep those days as close and dear to my heart as holidays were to me as a kid

92	OP left out the part where the co worker is a biological female. && Otherwise known as...a female.	And they masquerade around the workplace as a man, even going as far as to refer to themselves as a father.

93	It seems hard, but just don’t let it get to you. && If they are judging you, it’s not going to really affect you.	Plus, if they are judging you, they’re being quite hypocritical as it’s seen as a sin to judge.

94	I'm a bit of a lightweight, though, so I diluted it with equal parts water && water?	thats tough well i guess the taste isnt as strong as a plain vodka, so its okay

95	The 7 was my phone before my Pixel 2. && Great phone actually.	I liked camera in pixel 2, actually I had 7 as regular and pixel 2 as a spare for few weeks.

96	Tell me bout that crust! && I work at a chain, Papa Murphy's.	Haha so not as fancy as a proper takeout or dine in place.

97	Just your mentioning the Secret of Nimh got me feeling nostalgia. && I watched it earlier this year.	It was odd, for as much as I loved the movie as a kid, I really had trouble remembering the story.

98	Maybe I'll give sweatpants a try && A well-fitted pair of thermal underwear/long-johns might be the middle ground you're looking for.	Waffle weave for warmth - but not as warm as a thick pair of sweats.

99	I agree the holiday has evolved into something else. && I do feel bad for the turkeys a bit :/	Don't look at Thanksgiving as a bad day for turkeys, but as a nice day off for chickens.

100	I’m still trying to find a good one. && Just using the $5 ikea ones myself!	Man quality pillows are just as important as a mattress!

101	Trees by Joyce Kilmer && Absolutely brilliant.	The appreciation of something as overlooked as a tree, depicting it so beautifully and humanising it.

102	What’s something you used to dislike/hate but now love? && At some point during my childhood, I decided that I hated the color pink.	I don’t know why, as my mom dressed me in a variety of colors as a baby and as a toddler.

103	I’ve always had great teachers, so I can’t imagine you’ll be any different. && (Of course I don’t know you personally.	I just can’t imagine such as thing as a bad teacher.)

104	it 's because we believe we are in control when are driving . i think a lot of fear of flying comes from a sense of a loss of control . && yet have no problem with public transport ?	bus crash is n't anywhere near as dangerous as a plane crash .

105	interpol would be pretty useless in that case . only way to justify someone has commited an actual crime , is to prove him guilty during a trial . && interpol is pretty useless to begin with .	honestly the un as a whole is relatively useless as a whole .

106	what is your favorite metal track that pumps you up ? && as i lay dying - through struggle	the new tune " my own grave " is an absolute ripper also . say what you will about tim as a person but as a band they 're incredible .

107	what is something you say to freak people out ? && i was in a cult but it 's true so it 's double fun	i 've been a follower of and a leader of cults many times . you have more fun as a follower , make more money as a leader .

108	dubai marathon is tonight ! will we see a world record ? && bekele dropped out , it 's pretty sad ...	any news on why ? really pulling for him in 2017 . i hope he dropped out as a precaution rather than as a necessity .

109	thank god , a voice of reason in here . simpler is not always better . && but four cam shafts ! i have to buy four times as many upgrades for one upgrade !	it 's funny do the pushrod v8 guys complain about having to buy twice as many spark plugs as a turbo 4 would take ?

110	fair given there did n't seem to be any intent there but still dangerous && looked like intent to me . not sure what else it could have been if he was aiming that high up .	as much as people like to brand the jets as a dirty team i do n't play into that and i 'm a wild fan .

111	still a better weapon than a ladle or whatever the other 2 things are . && they 're those giant pizza trays . if there 's hot pizza on them , they could be kinda dangerous , probably .	still not as lethal as a carving knife . those things can do some serious damage

112	why even ask if 81k to 71 is nt enough of an answer ? && because the law requires that mdeq solicit public comments .	what 's even the point if they 're gon na ignore it like that . this seems about as undemocratic as a decision can get .

113	" cats do n't taste very well . " and " cats do n't taste very good . " are two very different things . && correct . well is an adverb , good is an adjective .	my friend 's family owns a farm in connecticut that has it 's own well . it 's a good well . well , it works as best as a well might .

114	not really uplifting news to car enthusiasts && they 're not banning cars . they 're just improving the engines . so car enthusiasts can rejoice too .	i do n't see electric motors which ca n't be modified as something to rejoice as a car enthusiast .

115	drink it ? && i did , i feel the power , i just want to know if i 'll be nodding off in 4 hours or not .	red bull has as much sugar as a can of soda , while bang is sugar free . so probably not .

116	i have an instant pot , and i 'm obsessed with it ! && what s that ?	slow cooker / pressure cooker combo . you can use as a traditional slow cooker , or as a pressure cooker and have that roast done in an hour or so .

117	diamond engagement rings && buy them used .	or get moissanite . very nearly as hard as a diamond , more brilliant , originally came from meteorites but is now synthetically created .

118	you think quebecers are bigots ? && only the ones that want to take rights away from muslim women .	are muslims men bigots then ? as they as a group deny women / gays their rights more than any other group in the world .

119	wow , look at mister " only 6 digits of debt " over here . && if you 're not in the millions what 's the point of even having debt	exactly ! the us is trillions in debt , might as well use them as a role model .

120	and yet they are . unions work wonders for cops . think what they could do for regular workers . && but reddit hates cops and how the unions protect them . oh now we 've come upon a conundrum !	if i had a union that protected me as vociferously as a police union , then i 'd have equal standing with a cop .

121	til i want to be a gibbon . they must have a good life , just swingin around . && took the words right out of my mouth . that looks like fun .	we 're are apes , our ancestors used to do that as well . i remember as a kid i loved to climb trees

122	the thing about satire is it has to mimic life in a funny manner . you 're just not satirical . && your relation with subjectivity has deteriorated your relation with <person> has deteriorated	just as important as keeping canada as a trading partner . i 'll mourn the loss of an unfunny nobody .

123	as a vikings fan this sounds like a fitting end for this season . && go pack !	as much as i inherently hate the packers as a vikings fan , i hope you beat us . it is unnatural for the lions to win the division .

510	whereabouts do you work ? upcoming safety guy here ! && it 's a large agricultural company . do n't want to say which one , but there are only so many . any questions ?	not really at the moment , just as big as a field we are apart of nowadays , i do n't see many of us on here . glad to meet you friend !

511	look at this guy wearing a gray beanie looking to purchase more gray beanies && i think i 'm missing the joke ..	the joke is that it is odd that someone would want replicates of something as bland as a grey beanie . are you okay ?

512	figure skating commentating is so hot right now . && hey , i met johnny weir last summer . he was very nice . he was the gayest man i 've ever met , but he was very nice .	to quote my mother , dude 's as gay as a $ 3 bill .

513	there is a disgusting trend of people trying to make quick money off of spiritual nonsense . && alan watts died about 35 years ago and i 'd argue he was one of best intermediary between eastern and western thought .	he did n't style himself as a religious leader , but as a speaker and entertainer .

514	what 's one of the dumbest things you 've heard someone say ? && " i can always tell whether they 're using real dinosaurs or not "	i 'm worried now that this is about me , as i said it deliberately loudly as a joke when i went to see jurassic world ..... (honest , it was a joke )

517	you could simulate falling at any speed using a treadmill . && people and things all fall at the same speed no matter how large they are . paper clip and bolder alike	not true . a piece of paper or feather will not fall as fast as a bowling ball .

518	it 's less easy . && a knife ? throw a sharp object at them ?	still not as easy as a gun . and we 're not even on the difficulty of killing more than one person at a time .

519	what are you tired of explaining to other people ? && long scar on my arm from a cat not a razor	scar on the top of my wrist from an oil burn that happens to be in a line . not as attention drawing as a scar from a cut on your arm though .

522	hmm ... all my mac windows are still open . strange && ooo look at this guy over here with his fancy mac . same hardware , more money .	i hate apple as much as the next guy , but as a bench - tech , i can say apple has the best solder beads and most consistent hardware quality .

523	well do n't leave us hanging ! is it haunted or what ? ? && probably a shot bearing / bushing in one of the fans . my first guess would be the psu fan . possibly an eviltron though .	well that 's just disappointing . nowhere near as exciting as a haunting .

524	another reason to love torts . && is there actually a torts fan base ? ?	i like him as a character , not as a coach ... so in some way i m a fan of his i guess .

525	there are n't any brownies ! && there were but they 're now three days old , so we had to throw them out .	there is actually an episode where the guy eats the brownies , but they had been sitting out for 3 days so they are as hard as a rock . brownies !

526	lord knows i 'm trying . && you should allow us to subscribe to reddit in exchange for an ad - free / data mining free experience .	never happen . you 're worth more money as a product than as a customer .

527	more i read about this group te more it sounds like scientology && dude , i had a similar thought . is it really that easy to start a cult ?	sure , i 've been in a few cults . you have more fun as a follower . make more money as a leader .

528	not with the race pace that car seems to have . although going from palmer to alonso would be tremendous && but they are bringing in a new front wing this weekend that will sort out the race pace .	no it wo nt . the problem is never as easy as a new wing .

529	german irish puerto rican && ah , so red from the german / irish + brown from the puerto rican . i 'm german / irish and italian myself but i tend to burn and then turn brown after .	irish / norwegian here . i burn and go right back to being as pale as a sheet

530	now that 's dedication to science && this is why real scientists have lab assistants . " ok , lenny , one more time for science . on three 1 2 .3 jump ! ! "	lenny is as pretty as a postcard , too . sorry , <url> 's married . to science !

531	eating horse <url> 's delicious and they are not pets . && for the most part they are . perhaps 100 years ago and before they were n't , but they are now .	really , a cow has just as much potential as a horse as a pet . and what about pigs

532	men all of the sudden start to experience monthly cycles ( periods ) . how would the world change ? && pads and tampons would n't be taxed	i do n't mind if they 're taxed , as long as they 're not taxed as a luxury .

533	that 's fine , but fuel to a fire . down vote all you want , but it is what it is . && why do you speak like visiting an african american history museum is a hostile act ?	yup , more playing dumb . what relevance does it have to the nba ? it 's just as pointless as a white house visit

534	have you ever dated anyone who was considered to be " out of your league " ? && everyone is out of your league when you are a 1	not 0.5/10 people . also , what kind of scale are you using ? imo a 1 is as rare as a 9 . please describe yourself .

535	what rule did your parents strictly enforce you realized was ridiculous once you got older ? && sugar cereals only on sundays ? i 'm 30 and still mad about that one .	that 's not that ridiculous , they 're not as healthy so you get them as a sunday treat . seems pretty reasonable .

536	a solid contract never approved by congress . that is an extremely important part of this situation . && it was an executive order , he had enough support from congress too .	he did not have support from congress as it was never passed through congress as a treaty . a majority of congress was against it .

537	i wonder which country that would be ? && what scared you more , russia as an ally or an enemy ? if you have to sit there scratching your head you are as sharp as a bowling ball .	am i as sharp as a needle if it only took me .0003ms to answer ?

538	the name of the wind by patrick rothfuss && it 's been on my to - read pile for a while . i started it once and it felt very generic and ' fantasy 101 ' .	that 's what he wants you to believe . read it not as a story , but as a dude telling you his story . the book has a lot of depth if you look at it .

539	what is the wisest , funniest , or most true thing you have ever said on another site ? && your mom . those are some really true and wise words .	my mom is a habitual liar and is as dense as a bed of bricks .

543	today i learned of the toyota prius gt300 , a v8 powered prius race car that races in the super gt series && why ? just why ?	why not ? it 's no different than using a honda civic as a touring car or a volvo as a v8 supercar .

544	instructions unclear , used butter && i wonder if you could use ghee . i mean that would be a bizarre and wasteful thing to do , but it would probably work .	ghee will work . the finish is n't as nice as a high heat unsaturated fat like flaxseed , grapeseed , or linseed , but it will work .

545	obama has authoritarian tendencies too . does n't mean there 's significant danger of the country becoming an autocracy . && there 's barely any comparison between the two .	the two who ? obama and trump ? there is about as big as a comparison can get . both will be / are president with an equal amount of power .

546	donating your kidney or liver is truly selfless because you are literally less of yourself . && pretty sure if you donate your liver you 'll be dead ...	you can live with half a liver , eventually that half will grow larger and become as functional as a full liver .

547	in this case , technically he 'd have been lying to congress , not mueller . still a paddlin ' . && yes , you are right .	well , he was right that prince was lying to congress , but he was wrong that it would result in any penalty as steep as a paddlin ' .

553	dad always loved social experiments && my uncle loved doing social experiments with me . then one day , he got arrested for some cat pictures or something .	my uncle loved roleplay . he played as a doctor and i played as a patient getting his prostate checked

554	so ... am i the only one who thought it kinda sucked ... ? && it was an actual movie with character arcs , and not just all jokes . seemed fine to me .	character arcs as predictable as a disney afterschool special . lame plot .

555	nyc had power within a day , the south shore took a couple weeks /months && just a reminder that pr is just as usa as ny	no i would n't say that . i do n't consider puerto rico to be as much american as a state . i see them as a separate nation operating under u.s . laws

557	no one thinks they 'll end up kissing a cat && whenever i see a kitties paws on something like the kitchen countertop or touching someone 's face all i can think about is a dirty litter box .	not an impossibility , but no animal , humans included , seems to spend as much time obsessively cleaning themselves as a cat , so ...

558	just showing dominance in his household && the real dominance came from using op 's blanket to clean himself after .	" i would fall asleep on the softest sheets imaginable and wake up with sheets as crunchy as a dorito , not sure why "

559	in swedish gift = married = poison && so when you 're gift and you do n't wanna be gift anymore you give gift as a gift ?	and now , someone who is gift giving gift as a gift as a gif !

561	using olive oil for asian cuisine . i know some like this but it ruins the flavor . && agree . sometimes you just need canola , sesame or peanut oil instead	sesame oil is used as flavoring , not as a cooking oil

562	yea but they 're quick and cheap && doing the right thing is n't always quick and cheap .	yea but how can you put them out of their misery quicker and more effectively ? they 're already in pain might as well finish them off as a courtesy .

563	but they 're not really oscar level . this movie is oscar bait , they need oscar actors to successfully lure the oscar out of its den . && how is 4-time oscar nominee michelle williams not oscar - caliber ?	do n't forget 2-time oscar nominee mark wahlberg edit : ( nominated once as an actor and once as a producer )

564	was it also responsible for them using admin / admin as username and pass on one of their public facing sites ? && come on , their cheif security offcer has an advanced degree , in music .	i do n't see anything wrong w / music major as undergrad , but as a fortune 500 company c - level , she should at least go get a relevant degree part - time .

565	would you rather be able to shoot spaghetti noodles out of your hands or shoot spaghetti sauce out of your hands ? && sauce , i think that would better disarm my enemies / attackers	see , i do n't even think of it as a superhero thing , just as a convenience thing . i think i 'd say the sauce too , but only if there 's meat chunks in it .

566	you can leave for another company that will pay you more . that is the difference . && i thought doctors could do that too ? is n't that what the whole brain drain threat is about ?	only by leaving the country . they ca n't do with nearly as easily as a salaried employee .

569	how is it meaningless ? what else are guns designed for ? why were they invented to begin with ? && so ban knives under the same justification ?	knives are supposed to be used as tools . use as a weapon is only an alternative purpose , like a baseball bat . a gun is built to be a weapon .

570	stalock has been way better than kuemper ever was so we can maybe actually afford to give dubnyk some rest this year . && you 're going to rely on alex " could n't even make the marlies " stalock ?	you 're going to rely on wayne " could n't even score as many points as a goalie in a home - and - home series " simmonds ?

571	the mortality rate for saplings can be incredible . 2 for 1 in some areas just wo nt cut it && i see what you did there .	it was as subtle as a brick in the face

572	that list is crazy but often things like anxiety disorder will couple with something like depression && i 'm actually diagnosed with depression , anxiety , and ocd . even i think it sounds over the top .	i mean ocd can outright cause the other two , so that 's about as outlandish as a boat made of butter having problems .

573	ahead of the game , i like it . && i feel like the shows about doomsday preppers would be a lot less interesting if they were planning for slow inevitable climate change .	because the story of someone buying a house on a hill would n't be as interesting as a zombie castle .

574	his dad publicly silencing him sounds alot more unlikely to happen than the king publicly silencing him edit : i do words good . && his dad is the king ...	they mean that his dad , in private acting not as a king , but as a father , could silence him ; but he would not do this publicly acting as the king .

575	i 'll do you one better ! && wtf that 's horrible ! was this actually part of the show ?	yup - totally real . i do n't know if it just was n't as creepy to watch as a kid or what , but ... dark , right ? !

576	you forgot to mention the beast . && which beast ? there are a lot of beasts .	the beast , one that preys almost exclusively on sheep , they say it 's as big as a jaguar , no man 's sheep are safe .

577	too much water && what do you mean ?	dumb meme , an ign review of pokemon x or y presented ' too much water ' ( as in water types ) as a negative aspect of the game

578	the mortiest morty and the pickliest rick ! dragoncon 2017 && hey , i missed a few , did the pickle episode run yet ?	yep , and about 4 others after it . was ok , a solid episode if you ignore the overhype the fans had for something as stupid as a pickle .

579	i kinda doubt rick and morty works as well without roiland 's voice(s ) . && i said the same thing about the rumors of a live action archer movie . the voice actors make the whole thing	just cast everyone as themselves . h. jon benjamin as a live action sterling archer would probably be one of the funniest things ever .

580	if getting an erection made a sound , what sound would you want it to make ? && morgan freeman narrating the process of the erection happening .	" and while his undergarments may be getting tighter now , he 's still as sweet as a jar of summer marmalade . "

582	* widowed . she died at their daughter 's wedding from a heart attack . && i like divorced better because they can make jokes about how awful his ex was .	as awful as she is as a human , part of the charm of the show is their marriage . i think it would cheapen the legacy some to make ex - wife pot shots .

583	you sound like you need a big hug , or at least a drink . && no dude , been winning for 2 years now , watching you people melt down every day is soooo much fun	the winning must be getting old . unless you redefine winning as having a complete douchebag as a president * not * being indicted yet ?

584	the culture defines the hivemind . they are n't any different from other humans physically , they just follow a different culture . && i see you 've never met anyone from another culture .	individuals does n't matter . you have to look at the big picture , the group as a whole and how that group as a whole behaves .

585	well it does n't help that drouin is a winger and montreal has no legitimate number one center && was drouin not a natural center before nhl ?	nope he played wing with mackinnon he was drafted as a winger and played as a winger when he was in tampa

586	there 's something wrong with those " gazelles " ... && hey , nothing runs like a gazelle .	no one 's slick as a gazelle no one 's quick as a gazelle no one 's neck 's as incredibly thick as a gazelle

591	hillary clinton was such a poor candidate that she lost to donald trump . && and bernie was so poor he lost to hillary .	that an independent too far to the left to be a democrat ran against her and put up as big as a challenge as he did is a big step forward .

592	never heard of her . but like natalia dyer from stranger things . && ah ok . because you said skinny , i thought you meant like really really really skinny	well dyer is really skinny lol . that 's about as skinny as a girl can get before she 's basically officially on the sickly looking side .

593	my point was , that for the second child'a birth she was already mother && even if it 's her second , she still gave birth on that day	but it 's not a " birth as mother " because she is already a mother . i understood you op as a metaphor , not as a real birthday , of course .

594	that the approximately correct amount of loose leaf tea for one cup is ..... a teaspoonful . && this blew my mind ... but what did tablespoons measure ?	i do n't think they 're intended as a measure so much as a normal spoon size for use at the table , like for eating soup or such .

595	would n't it be a slice of canadian bacon instead of sausage ? && i 'm pretty sure they make a bacon egg mc muffin and a sausage egg mc muffin	yup . the sausage one is my preference . it baffles me how something as perfect as a sausage egg mcmuffin can come from a place like mcdonalds .

596	since china is so committed to green energy ( they are huge investors in it ) maybe this would be a good thing ? && they make a new coal plant every week .	they are as committed as they can realistically be as a manufacturing nation

597	we both know that they would n't have put on their seatbelt even if it was the law . && they would rather pay fines repeatedly and risk their lives instead of just putting a seat belt ?	so them risking their life is n't as much of as a deterrent as fines ?

598	wikileaks already has information about the orange comrade that they could have released before the election . <url> && keep calling the most right - wing president in decades " comrade " . always got ta punch left !	" comrade " is n't referring to him as a communist , but rather as a russian ( agent ) .

601	an opening is different from a hole . adding an opening does not necessarily make another hole . && hmm ... if i poke a hole through a piece of paper - it has 2 openings ?	sure it does . they 're very close together at our scale but if you are 1/100th as tall as a sheet of paper they 'd be quite apparent .

606	how do you all feel about this ? && all i have to say is i am glad i am close to graduation now that all of these teachers are catching on to chegg .	so chegg is n't seen as a helpful tool , but more as a way to cheat ?

607	this show was gold && when the barbarian in the group rolls a 20 on an intelligence check	there 's so much geek in that one sentence that it should receive gold . unfortunately , i 'm as poor as a barbarian .

611	as a german i really do nt understand why this guy is still allowed to play president . && because he won democracy	" democracy " i 'm not sure if giving some people 3 - 4x the voting power as other people counts as a real democracy . a handicapped democracy maybe .

1215	Shoegaze, Ambient, and Indie Rock are what I always end up falling back into :) && I'm familiar with ambient and indie rock but is shoe gaze a band?	Shoe gaze is like a sub-genre to rock that deals a lot with synths, distortion guitar, dreamy aesthetics, that type of thing.

1222	I feel exactly the same way. && I never changed sexuality or gender but I'm 22 and I feel like I'm experiencing my life the way a 13 or 14 year old would.	I just had my first girlfriend 2 years ago (it sucked), and I'm listening to edgy music and all around acting like a teenager.

1223	Sometimes you'd rather leave, not because you don't love them, but because you love them too much. && You said in some other comment that some friend zoning in HS taught you a lesson.

1225	At least it was. && Now that I'd like to take it a step further I will need help.	The game would be like a mix between a card game like Magic the Gathering with a pictonary like concept and also Dungeons and Dragons.

1226	I'm hungry, what do you guys think I should eat? && Just had my gallbladder removed a few days ago, so I'm back in business baby.	I can't eat anything too greasy, but I can eat like a normal human again at least.

1227	I was firmly grabbed by the arm and taken inside. && The caretaker put me in this room in the mansion I had never been before.	It was like a study, large windows, high ceilings, book shelves against the walls, an old wooden table near the natural lighting.

1229	Four players on my team, and four players and the other. && Suddenly, we were warped up to the plane like we should have been about 10 minutes ago.

1230	I started rubber band wars, played pranks, cracked jokes, messed around on the walkie-talkies, and basically got into mischief. && Before long work became fun.	People laughed and joked and eventually we became like a family.

1231	For me at least, I listen to more relaxing and emotional songs and think about people that I miss. && I have a love hate relationship with these days	I know what you mean... it’s like a cool-down period when you’re just down, but not depressed, just down.

1232	Share your own thougts. && Is there anyone out there who thinks about creating something like a blog just so you have an outlet for all the things youre thinking about?	It would be like a blog where you write something when ever you feel like it.

1233	And maybe if they just seem cool, I strike up a conversation with them with a PM. && And not only that, but if their from a different country, I learn a little more about culture.	I don’t know, I just find it cool, like a little peek into another life, you know.

1234	The singer sounded a little tired, but I feel that the lyrics and instrumentations would make a great Pink Floyd song. && Also, the music video was amazing.	It was like a very clean version of Requiem for a Dream.

1235	Yet it was all very chill, and they were very friendly. && Later my GF told me that her mother really liked me, specially because I didn't just say "uhum" like she expected.	In summary, don't be what I was a year ago, just try to act like a regular human being if you want to be on the good side of someone.

1236	(On this account :D ) &#x200B; Rest in peace all my Karma, posts and my cake day :p && I’m thinking of creating a second Reddit account.	My current one I use like a regular Reddit account, but I want one for irl people.

1237	I wonder if a schizophrenic person would be able to blend in and function in society. && Could we interact on the daily with someone diagnosed with schizophrenia and not even know?	I have mild schizophrenia and people treat me as a normal person, and yes I’m able to function like a normal person.

1238	What are you doing for New Year's Eve? && I have no idea what I am doing yet, but probably working.	I work in an Irish themed pub and we are doing a champagne toast and party favors at midnight, so it'll be like a huge party except I get paid to be there lol (I'm a server).

1253	I answer with "I decided to stop being fat". && Turns out people get really mad lmfao.	I know a girl that would say 'i started thinking like a skinny person', lol
