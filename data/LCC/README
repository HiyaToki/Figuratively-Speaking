There are two associated xsd files -- large.xsd and small.xsd.

Attributes for the XML elements are defined as follows:

annotatorID=<NUMBER>, uniquely identifying one of our annotators
chain=<SEQUENCE>, indicating the relationhsip from the source to the target via prep-condensed MALT PARSER relations (with * indicating the common subsumer of source/target)
creationTime=<NUMBER>, timestamp (ms) of annotation instance
docid=<NUMBER>, uniquely identifying one of our documents
id=<NUMBER>, uniquely identifying an annotation (of a particular type). Note that a MetaphoricityAnnotation and a PolarityAnnotation might have the same id.
intensity=<NUMBER> (0, 1, 2, 3)
polarity=<VALUE> (NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL, POSITIVE)
protagonist=<VALUE> (GENERAL, GOVERNMENT_OVERSIGHT, INDIVIDUAL_OVERSIGHT)
score=<NUMBER> (-1, 0, 1, 2, 3), where -1 indicates invalid syntactic relation between a source/target (only used for MetaphoricityAnnotations)
